The CPS2RL, led by [Dr. Monowar Hasan](http://monowarhasan.info/){:target="_blank"}, primarily conducts research in the *Systems* and *Networking* area. Our research aims to improve the security and resiliency of cyber-physical systems, real-time systems, edge computing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and vehicular communication networks.

### Current Research Projects

* Security for real-time systems
* Scheduling and  resiliency of software-defined real-time networks
* Security and resource management of vehicular communication networks
* Real-time machine learning for smart manufacturing systems

### Open-resource Releases

We promote reproducibility in Systems research and frequently release our implementation and software artifacts. Please visit our public repositories:
